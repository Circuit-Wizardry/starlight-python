# Starlight
Starlight is an all-in-one flight computer with all sorts of features useful to have in a model rocket flight computer.
You can read more about the board [here]([url](https://shop.circuitwizardry.com/products/starlight)https://shop.circuitwizardry.com/products/starlight).

This repository contains all the code necessary to interface with the sensors on STARLIGHT.

Check out `example.py` for a quick start on reading sensors on the board, and `starlight.py` for the raw code that talks to the two sensors!
